### Supporting readings

* ["Kindergarten Grammars"](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/course-materials/blob/master/Readings/Stiny%20-%20Kindergarten%20Grammars.pdf)

#### Supplemental Readings

* ["Using It to Design"](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/course-materials/blob/master/Readings/Stiny%20-%20Using%20it%20to%20Design%20-%20Shapes.pdf)
  * This reading might prove to be a very helpful resource

## Activity

Your task for this presentation is to find a structure which aligns to or has sympathies with your Individual Manifesto and model two kinds of shape grammars. This is referred to below as your **reference structure**.

- [ ] First, describe the shape grammar of the facade of the **reference structure**.
  * Select what you believe to be the "face" of the structure and decode which "words" (shapes) make up the "grammar" of the image
  * If you're having difficulty finding compatible ructures, please reach out to me and we can consult
- [ ] Create a 2D paper reconstruction of this picture using that grammar
- [ ] Enumerate which shapes make up the "words" of this grammar
- [ ] List what you believe the "rules" of the grammar to be as you perceive them

- [ ] Second, using the grammar you've extracted from your **reference structure**, your task is to create a shape grammar which chooses one of the following motivations to construct a monument:
  * Historical or fictitious event
  * Historical or fictitious person
  * Historical or fictitious place/landscape

## Deliverables


   ["Shape Grammar"](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/presentation-1-shape-grammar-szklenskij/blob/master/shape%20grammer.pdf)


- [ ] A presentation (using Google Slides or another sequential media format i.e. Powerpoint) using the following structure:
  * A slide/page with the chosen **reference structure**'s name, architect, location, and year of construction
  * A slide/page showing all shapes in the "grammar" labeled by type using at least 10 adjectives to describe the grammar:
    * Adjectives might include: "severe," "geometric," "smooth" (et al.)
  * A slide/page with a reconstruction of the facade ("face") of the reference building using this grammar
  * A slide/page showing the shape grammar construction of your monument
  * A slide/page with a short statement (less than 150 words) describing the relationship between the grammar and the form created
- [ ] Pictures of any grammars should go in the `media` directory
- [ ] Sketches or any other "draft" work should be placed in the `studies` directory

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness
- [ ] Relationship to design goals in manifesto, general justification
